# PyTorch Model Library

This directory contains pretrained PyTorch models from various sources such as [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [TorchVision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html). Models can be imported using `torch-mlir`. See the script `update_torch_models.sh` for example usage.
