# Transform Dialect Tooling

This directory contains a few simple tools to enhance productivity of IREE
experiments based on the transform dialect.

## Script

Contains shell functions that simplify running IREE tools with the transform
dialect. These should generally be considered brittle but may be useful to some.

First, source the script file:
```
source iree-samples/transform_dialect/scripts.sh
```

For execution, assumptions are:
  1. execution starts from the IREE source dir root
  2. the IREE build directory lives at `./build`
  3. `mlir-opt` is in the path
  4. `./build/tools` (i.e. `iree-opt`, `iree-compile`, `iree-run-module`) is in the path
  5. the iree tools are built with assertions enabled
  6. for CUDA execution, `nvprof` is in the path.

Disclaimers:
  1. since the exploration process can involve modifying source IR, transform IR
  and the compiler itself, each command compiles what it needs to simplify and
  automate the process. This may be surprising if one does not want recompilation
  to occur.
  2. examples are restricted to the CUDA case for now.
  3. examples are restricted to 2-D reduction cases for now.
  4. the stub file can have multiple functions, but they all should have private
  visibility. We use a poor man's `sed`-based filter of the function we care
  about by replacing the visibility of that one function and letting
  `mlir-opt -symbol-dce` clean the IR for us.

Note: the underlying helper functions `iree-transform-xxx` can be parameterized to
other backends and CUDA is not a strong restriction, just a convenience.

### Create a New Problem To Map

Run:
```
(\
  benchmark-transform-create \
  -b cuda \
  <iree-samples-dir-path>/transform_dialect/benchmark_linalg_reductions.stub.mlir \
  reduction_2d_static \
  f32 \
  123 \
  456 \
)
```

This should print something resembling:
```
==========================================================
Problem created successfully, reproduction instructions:
==========================================================
Transform dialect source file is: /tmp/reduction_2d_static_123x456.mlir
Transform dialect transform file is: /tmp/iree_transform_dialect_ac2e60.mlir
Dump transformed IR with: benchmark-transform-run-iree-opt -b cuda /tmp/reduction_2d_static_123x456.mlir /tmp/iree_transform_dialect_ac2e60.mlir
Dump transformed PTX with: benchmark-transform-run-iree-compile -b cuda /tmp/reduction_2d_static_123x456.mlir /tmp/iree_transform_dialect_ac2e60.mlir
Run nvprof with e.g.: benchmark-transform-run-nvprof /tmp/reduction_2d_static_123x456.mlir /tmp/iree_transform_dialect_ac2e60.mlir reduction_2d_static 123 456
==========================================================
```


### Produce Transformed IR

Manually modify the content of the transform IR file (or not) (i.e. /tmp/iree_transform_dialect_ac2e60.mlir), then run:

```
( \
  benchmark-transform-run-iree-opt \
  -b cuda \
  /tmp/reduction_2d_static_123x456.mlir \
  /tmp/iree_transform_dialect_ac2e60.mlir \
)
```

This should print the transformed IR (or appropriate error messages when relevant).

This provides an easy to interact with interpreted mode.

### Produce Transformed PTX

Once the transformed IR is in a satisfactory state, one can inspect the PTX.

```
( \
  benchmark-transform-run-iree-compile \
  -b cuda \
  /tmp/reduction_2d_static_123x456.mlir \
  /tmp/iree_transform_dialect_ac2e60.mlir \
)
```

This should print the transformed PTX (or appropriate error messages when relevant).

Note: Make sure to redirect the output in a `.vmfb` file (which is just a zip
archive), otherwise, you'll taste the binary output directly. This is
particularly painful if dumping non-PTX backends.

## Run and Benchmark

The following requires nvprof to be in the PATH.

When things look good, one can execute, get a filtered nvprof trace and a rough
estimate of the performance by pasting the last repro command:

```
(
  benchmark-transform-run-nvprof \
  -b cuda \
  /tmp/reduction_2d_static_123x456.mlir \
  /tmp/iree_transform_dialect_ac2e60.mlir \
  reduction_2d_static \
  f32 \
  123 \
  456 \
)
```

Prints something resembling:
```

```

Note how the first instance takes significantly longer due to initial host->device
memory copies.

The reproduction instructions can be run independently and adapted.

It is the responsibility of the user to convert the number of elements processed
per second (i.e. the product of the sizes) to the relevant metric for the benchmark.
In the case of reduction_2d_static, a `tensor<123x456xf32>` is read and reduced
into a `tensor<123xf32>`.
This corresponds to 4 bytes read per element and a negligible amount of bytes
written per element.

This gives us roughly `80GB/s` read bandwidth, in `2.8us` (latency-bound).

We can generate and run another problem by adding the `-r` argument:
```
( \
  benchmark-transform-create -r \
  -b cuda \
  <iree-samples-dir-path>/transform_dialect/benchmark_linalg_reductions.stub.mlir \
  reduction_2d_static \
  f32 \
  123 \
  45678 \
)
```

The various repro instructions are printed and the problem is also run:

## Python Scripts

The `python` directory includes a few additional useful scripts for common verification
flows of individual dispatches. Setup/usage details can be found there.
